## Newsletter Opt-in Modal Plugin
This WordPress plugin is designed to increase newsletter sign-ups by displaying an opt-in modal to the user. The modal follows the user's viewpoint as they scroll through the site, and is consistently positioned in the middle of the screen.

## Installation
Download the plugin folder.
Upload the plugin folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/newsletter-optin-modal' directory on your WordPress site.
Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
Usage
Once the plugin is activated, the newsletter opt-in modal will be visible on all pages of the site. The modal cannot be submitted with empty fields, and once the user submits their name and email, this information is recorded in a database table specific to the newsletter.

The modal will close automatically after the user submits the form, and will not be displayed again on page refresh after the form has been submitted.

## Customization
To customize the appearance of the modal, edit the CSS in the 'newsletter-optin-modal.css' file located in the plugin folder.

## Dependencies
This plugin does not require any external libraries or dependencies.
